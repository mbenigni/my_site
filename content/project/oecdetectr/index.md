Online social networks have become a powerful venue for political activism. In many cases large, insular online communities form that have been shown to be powerful diffusion mechanisms of both misinformation and propaganda.  We see these methods primarily as a means to study online communities and their role in political activism.  **OECdetectR** enables analysis of large Twitter snowball samples enabled by [TwitterDM](https://github.com/kennyjoseph/twitter_dm).  We offer a tutorial using online discussion centered around the Euromaidan Movement on Twitter.
