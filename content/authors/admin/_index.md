I am a technical and strategic data science advisor within the Department of Defense. I specialize in building enterprise analytic teams and enabling digital transformation, and currently serve as the Chief Data Scientist for USSOCOMâ€™s Global Analytics Platform.  My interests are at the intersection of data science and national security with a focus on applied intelligence augmentation through machine learning. I am interested in collaboration with fellow practitioners from industry, academia, law enforcement and security.

I am not seeking job opportunities, nor am I an entry point for vendor solutions into the Department of Defense.
