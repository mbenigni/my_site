While traditional social network methods have been used in assessing social media data, they are insufficient to identify and characterize social influence bots, the networks in which they reside and their behavior. However, these bots can be identified, their prevalence assessed, and their impact on groups assessed using high dimensional network analytics. This is illustrated using data from three different activist communities on Twitter—the “alt-right,” ISIS sympathizers in the Syrian revolution, and activists of the Euromaidan movement. We observe a new kind of behavior that social influence bots engage in—repetitive @mentions of each other. This behavior is used to manipulate complex network metrics, artificially inflating the influence of particular users and specific agendas. We show that this bot behavior can affect network …","tags":null,"title":"Bot-ivistm: Assessing Information Manipulation in Social Media Using Network Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[null,"kathleen carley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"ea28ce3dc73d407df4b1af838db043e2","permalink":"/publication/sbp_brims/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbp_brims/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the CASOS Jihadist Twitter Community (CJTC), an online community of over 15,000 Twitter users that support one or more of the Islamic extremist groups engaged in the ongoing conicts in Northern Iraq and Syria.
