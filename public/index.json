While traditional social network methods have been used in assessing social media data, they are insufficient to identify and characterize social influence bots, the networks in which they reside and their behavior. However, these bots can be identified, their prevalence assessed, and their impact on groups assessed using high dimensional network analytics. This is illustrated using data from three different activist communities on Twitter—the “alt-right,” ISIS sympathizers in the Syrian revolution, and activists of the Euromaidan movement. We observe a new kind of behavior that social influence bots engage in—repetitive @mentions of each other. This behavior is used to manipulate complex network metrics, artificially inflating the influence of particular users and specific agendas. We show that this bot behavior can affect network …","tags":null,"title":"Bot-ivistm: Assessing Information Manipulation in Social Media Using Network Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":[null,"kathleen carley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"ea28ce3dc73d407df4b1af838db043e2","permalink":"/publication/sbp_brims/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbp_brims/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the CASOS Jihadist Twitter Community (CJTC), an online community of over 15,000 Twitter users that support one or more of the Islamic extremist groups engaged in the ongoing conicts in Northern Iraq and Syria. We briefly discuss the methods used to detect and monitor these communities and highlight forms of information that can be extracted from them. We then present an active social botnet that attempts to elevate the social influence of users supportive to Jabhat al-Nusra's agenda. In each case we highlight the ability of these methods to incorporate regional expertise for better performance and recommend future research.","tags":null,"title":"From tweets to intelligence: Understanding the islamic jihad supporting community on twitter","type":"publication"},{"authors":[null,"kenneth joseph","kathleen carley"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"16ae4baefa29cbcf4212ba3566b49786","permalink":"/publication/plos_one/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/plos_one/","section":"publication","summary":"We present Iterative Vertex Clustering and Classification (IVCC), a scalable analytic approach for OEC detection in annotated heterogeneous networks, and provide an illustrative case study of an online community of over 22,000 Twitter users whose online behavior directly advocates support for ISIS or contibutes to the group’s propaganda dissemination through retweets.","tags":null,"title":"Online Extremism and the Communities that Sustain It","type":"publication"},{"authors":[null,"reinhard furrer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1441065600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1441065600,"objectID":"95102e4eb52c7cd465f6b81bade233ef","permalink":"/publication/ieds/","publishdate":"2012-08-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ieds/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a statistical model that reduces the spatial location to one dimension and uses a cyclic time as a second dimension.
