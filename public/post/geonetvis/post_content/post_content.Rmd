# First Section
Generating a post on the [SKOPE Knowledge Hub](https://skopeknowledgehub.itss.forcenex.us/) is just too easy with the RStudio and the [SKOPEdocumenteR Package](https://gitlab.master.forcenex.us/gap/skope/skopedocumenter)!

Check out this cool quote:

<div class="qte">

"Data Science is the discipline of making data useful." Its three subfields involve mining large amounts of information for inspiration (analytics), making decisions wisely based on limited information (statistics), and using patterns in data to automate tasks (AI/ML)."

  addTiles() %>%
